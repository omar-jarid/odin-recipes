        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These easy lemon cake mix brownies are frosted with a sweet-tart, lemony icing. They're easy to make and delightfully fresh.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (15.5 ounce) box lemon cake mix</li>
            <li>1/3 cup canola oil</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 1/2 to 2 cups confectioners sugar, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon zest</li>
            <li>1 to 2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Lightly grease an 11x7-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Mix lemon cake mix, canola oil, eggs, and vanilla extract in a bowl until well combined. Spread the mixture in the prepared dish in an even layer.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick comes out clean when inserted into the center, 16 to 18 minutes. Allow brownies to cool for about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, combine 1 1/2 cups confectionerâ€™s sugar, lemon zest, and lemon juice in a bowl; whisk until smooth; add more sugar as needed for a smooth, spreadable glaze. Stir in salt.</li>
            <li>Spread lemon glaze evenly over brownies and let stand until completely cooled. Refrigerate until ready to serve; cut into 12 squares.</li>
        </ol>
